    <h1>Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization</h1>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        It is tempting to think of data and visualization as a neutral actor, with a single “correct” set of design choices that
        “truthfully” report the data. However, outside of egregious errors (e.g., when dates are sorted incorrectly or the
        y-axis is not scaled uniformly), we see that “ground truth” in data is much more contextual and situated. Design choices
        we make give visualization a rhetorical power that influences what a reader concludes and remembers about the data, and
        blurs the line between persuasion and deception. This project aims to demonstrate this concept by showcasing two visualizations 
        made from the same dataset but on opposing sides of a proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Design decisions will be discussed and scored on a diverging scale from -2 to 2, how deceptive or earnest the decision is (where -2 is fully deceptive, 0 is neutral, and
        2 is fully earnest).
    </p>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        The data for this project can be found here: 
        <a href="https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers">Civilian
            Complaints Against New York City Police Officers</a>. This dataset was compiled by ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit 
            investigative journalism newsroom. It contains more than 12,000 civilian complaints filed against the NYPD, with demographic 
            information about the complainant and officer, the category of the alleged misconduct, and the result of the complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will focus on a specific feature of this dataset - <strong>Board Disposition</strong>: Each complaint in the dataset was investigated by NYPD and
        the investigations results fall into one of three categories:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exonerated:</strong> (29%) - The alleged conduct occurred but did not violate NYPD’s rules</li>
            <li><strong>Unsubstantiated:</strong> (46%) - The CCRB fully investigated but could not affirmatively conclude both that the conduct occurred and that it broke
            the rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Substantiated:</strong> (25%) - The alleged conduct occurred and it violated the rules.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Aggregating unsubstantiated and substantiated complaints: Score -1 Deceptive</strong>
            <p>In this plot, I aggregate all unsubstantiated and substantiated complaints together and declare them "Not Exonerated" (shown in red). While
                this is technically valid, it implies that in all these cases, officer misconduct was found. In reality the majority 
                of the complaints in this aggregation (65%) are unsubstantiated. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Using a hidden second y axis for "not exonerated" complaints: Score -2 Very Deceptive</strong>
            <p>
                The blue bars and the left y-axis are cleary labeled "Total Compliants". The plot layout implies that the the number of "Not Exonerated"
                complaints is overlaid in red bars using the same y-axis. However, there is a hidden second y-axis that scales the red bars to make them 
                taller. This is a very deceptive technique, meant to give the reader the idea that only a very small percentage of complaints each year are
                exonerated. The viewer can only discover this deception if they hover over the red bars and observe that the bar values don't match the left 
                y-axis.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Exaggerated language in the title and caption: Score -1 Deceptive</strong>
            <p>
                The title uses the word "rarely" to descibe the proportion of complaints where officers are exonerated. The actual proportion is 26%,
                therefore, using "rarely" exaggerates this fact. Similarly in the caption, I use the phrase "vast majority" to describe the 74% of 
                cases where the officer is not exonerated. Both of these language choices reinforce the deception above. 

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Using partial data: Score -1 Deceptive</strong>
            <p>
                The dataset includes data back to year 1985, however, I only used data after 1997. Due to the deceptive scaling of the red bars, 
                the red bars are higher than the blue in years before 1997. Having several years where there appeared to be no complaints
                where officers were exonerated was too unbelievable. It also made the "Total Complaints" bars less interperetable.

    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Aggregating unsubstantiated and exonerated complaints: Score -1 Deceptive</strong>
            <p>As in figure 1, I deceptively aggregated the data. This time, I combined unsubstantiated complaints and 
                exonerated complaints and label them as "No Misconduct Found". While the characterization is true, it hides 
                the fact that in most of these cases (62%), the review board couldn't determine if the alleged incident 
                actually happened. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Focusing on the number of complaints where no misconduct was found: Score 0 Neutral</strong>
            <p>The purpose of the visualization is to show that officer misconduct is not a growing isue. The visualization
                design diverts the
                focus to complaints where the officer was not found of misconduct. It is somewhat of a diversion to avoid the
                fact that there
                are actually more complaints that result in misconduct offenses. However, it's representation of the data is
                still valid, though
                difficult to interpret.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Plotting both traces on same y-axis: Score -2 Very Deceptive</strong>
            <p>
                The large number of cases where no misconduct was found (blue bars) stretches out the y-axis. The red bars are actaully 
                the percent of cases where misconduct occurs, not the number. Since these mostly range from 15% - 35%, they are
                extremely outweighed by the blue bars. To notice this deception, the viewer must first notice the % sign after the misconduct 
                found trace in the legend. Then they must perform a significant cognitive lift to determine that in fact both traces are
                scaled to the same axis, as this is not hinted anywhere. The red bar data is available on hoverover, and can be more easily 
                viewed by turning off the blue trace in the legend.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Misleading and exaggerated language in the title and caption: Score -1 Deceptive</strong>
            <p>
                The title implies that complaints where no misconduct are found are "false", which is misleading since some of the complaints
                may have involved officer misconduct but it wasn't able to be determined by the review board. As in figure 1, the subtitle and
                the caption use "rarely" and "vast majority" as exaggerations of the proportions they represent.
